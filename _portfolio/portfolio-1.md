To date, white-box adversarial methods are only capable of attacking convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection models. In this project, I devise a novel attention-based attack that is capable of corrupting both CNN-based and transformer-based approaches. Early results show that this method is effective against many of the state-of-the-art object detection models, having implications for important applications like autonomous driving, radiology, facial recognition, and more. 

This project is currently in development.
