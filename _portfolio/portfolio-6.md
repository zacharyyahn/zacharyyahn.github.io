Worked with a teammate to propose a blockchain-based solution to deepfakes. Wrote a whitepaper outlining the techonology and supporting literature and submitted it to the competition. The system would involve using a video hash and storing hashes in smart contracts authenticated by trustworthy news organizations. The competition was open to undergraduate and graduate students, and the second-place team was composed of four PhD students.
