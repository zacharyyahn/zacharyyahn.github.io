This website was a semester-long team project. I served as the DevOps engineer for the team. The website was built using the Django framework in Python, and also incorporated elements of JavaScript. It was hosted on Heroku free tier and used PostgresDB.  The project involved enumerating specific design requirements, writing unit tests, and generating clean production-quality code. All work was done in sprints per agile methodologies. 

Unfortunately, the website is no longer up, as it was removed from Heroku free tier.
