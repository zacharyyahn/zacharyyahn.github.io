Hi, I'm Zach! I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech studying in the Distributed Data-Intensive Systems Lab under Prof. Ling Liu. My research is in adversarial attacks on deep vision systems, and broadly I'm interested in technologies that make our AI systems safer, more interpretable, and more transparent. I have a proven track record of successful research projects, and I'm currently looking for research internship positions for Summer 2025. Thanks for visiting my site!
