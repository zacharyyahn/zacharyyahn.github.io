## The Vision and Analytics Lab (THEIA) - University College Dublin
*Graduate Research Assistant* (Apr. 2024 - Aug. 2024)
* Full-time masters thesis research.
* Investigated super-resolution methods for remote sensing and nitrogen-dioxide prediction.
* Pioneered an ultra-lightweight model capable of slotting into an image pre-processing pipeline and achieving similar results to state-of-the-art super-resolution models. 
* Achieved top nitrogen-dioxide prediction results and developed code for comparing implementations of various popular architectures.

## NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
*Machine Learning Research Intern* (Aug. 2021 - Aug. 2023)
*   Developed a semantic segmentation approach to identifying methane clouds in Titanâ€™s atmosphere using low-resolution images from the Cassini mission with a custom software suite for analysis.
*   Deployed a Pytorch Mask-RCNN with Keras model on Google Cloud Platform including labelling raw images and creating a data pipeline. 
*   Published first-author results at conferences and in journals. 

## Duke University
*Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Fellow* (May. 2021 - Aug 2021)
*   Selected to conduct research with the Humans and Autonomy Lab under Prof. Missy Cummings and Dr. Songpo Li alongside other researchers.
*	Constructed a machine learning model to classify injuries on U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, including extensive data cleaning and feature selection.

## University of Michigan
*Deep Learning Research Intern* (May 2021 - Aug. 2021)
*   Collaborated with a research group dedicated to developing 1Cademy, an online deep learning education website open to the public.
*	Researched deep learning topics including optimization, regularization, training, and convolutional and recurrent networks, presented weekly findings to the group. 

## University of Virginia
*Undergraduate Research Assistant* (Jun. 2020 - Aug. 2021)
